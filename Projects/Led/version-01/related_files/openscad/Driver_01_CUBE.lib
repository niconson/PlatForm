//  This cube is designed to create projections of printed 
//  circuit board(PCB) parts independently from each other 
//  on both the bottom and top sides.This is done by subtracting 
//  the parts on the opposite side from the original 3D model 
//  using the different() function.To obtain a projection of the 
//  top - side parts, subtract the bottom - side parts, and vice versa.
